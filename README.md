# Dmail

__Decentralized email running on the Ethereum Blockchain__

Dmail is a full stack decentralized application running on the Ethereum network that facilitates secure storage and retrieval of encrypted messages. Our initial implementation uses RSA to encrypt messages: users can generate public/private key pairs in their browser and then store their public keys and ciphertext on the blockchain.

JavaScript on the front end handles encryption, decryption, and key generation, and then calls our Solidity smart contract to interact with the blockchain. You can access your mailbox through our UI, which maps your walletâ€™s address to memory on the blockchain containing your public key and any encrypted messages sent to you. You can then decrypt these messages by using your private key. You can verify that no malicious Javascript is run to expose your private key, as our website's source code is available on GitHub.
